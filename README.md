# D(e)ad Jokes

D(e)ad Jokes is a game about a comedian's nightmare trying to find the right joke to appease an evermore demanding audience.

It was developed for the [Global Game Jam 2024](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/dead-jokes-5) and you can [play it right now!](https://shoeffner.github.io/GGJ-24-sabelkalat/).

Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to focus your cards and swap them, tell the joke with <space> and swap the view with <tab>.
